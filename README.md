MoodMeow is a completely useless, but dangerously adorable web app where you can only type "meow" — nothing else. Every time you meow, the app gives you a totally unpredictable cat mood in response — like "sleepy", "hungry", "wants fish curry", "judging you silently", or "wants to destroy the curtains again".
